WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT?
This is a simple html project whereby i am going to be building a basic recipe website.
It is important to note that initially the project might not look all that pretty by the time i am done because i am only going to be practicing my HTML chops.
LEARNING EXPECTATIONS AT THE END OF THE PROJECT
By the end of this project i should be more conversant with the various tags and syntaxes of HTML and confident to be anble to apply anywhere.
